<p><strong>Darien, CT — Cherry Lawn Park.</strong> What began as a drizzly Sunday morning showdown quickly turned into the most stunning upset in the heated rivalry between Charles Coplin and Jerry Charlup — a feud that’s been simmering for years and finally boiled over on a slick, rain-soaked pickleball court.</p>

<p>Charles, entering the match undefeated this season and carrying what several spectators politely described as a “noticeable chip on his shoulder,” paired with steady veteran Jay Baker. Across the net stood Jerry Charlup and Nick Cirillo, a duo known more for chaotic highlight-reel points than consistency — until today.</p>

<p>The match began with a rally so long that two separate players reportedly asked, “Are we still playing the same point?” Charles opened the game with a blistering cross-court forehand that skidded off the wet line like a hockey puck. Jerry responded with an improbable no-look wrist-flick winner that caught even Nick off guard.</p>

<p>Then came the collapse.</p>

<p>After dropping the first three points, Charles and Jay never regained momentum. A series of mis-hits, slips, and one moment where Charles shook his paddle at the sky in disbelief drove the momentum sharply in Jerry and Nick’s direction.</p>

<p>It ended in a stunning, emphatic score: <strong>11–0.</strong></p>

<p>In pickleball, this is known as being <strong>“pickled”</strong> — the equivalent of a shutout, a shut-down, and a shut-the-front-door all at once. It’s rare. It’s humiliating. And it almost never happens to an undefeated player with a legendary grudge match on the line.</p>

<p>Spectators described the final point: Jerry hit a soft, feathery dink that barely crossed the net. Charles lunged, slipped, skidded, recovered, and barely tapped the ball — only to watch it float gently into the net. Nick allegedly whispered, “That’s game,” before the ball even landed.</p>

<p>Even more astonishing were the fake-but-vivid stats recorded by onlookers:</p>

<ul>
    <li>• Charles' average paddle velocity dropped from 41 mph to 7 mph after point five.</li>
    <li>• Jerry hit an improbable 4 winners from behind the baseline — in the rain.</li>
    <li>• Nick's celebratory fist-pumps increased by 600% in the final three points.</li>
    <li>• Jay Baker was credited with “the most polite apologies for missed shots” in Cherry Lawn history.</li>
</ul>

<p>Afterward, Charles was gracious in defeat, though clearly stunned. He declined comment, but his expression suggested he was mentally replaying each of the 11 unanswered points in slow motion, possibly for the next decade.</p>

<p>One thing is certain:  
This rivalry — already bitter — has now crossed into legendary territory.</p>
