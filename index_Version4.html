<p><strong>Darien, CT — Cherry Lawn Park.</strong> What began as a drizzly Sunday morning showdown quickly turned into the most stunning upset in the heated rivalry between Charles Coplin and Jerry Charlup — a feud that’s been simmering for years and finally boiled over on a slick, rain-soaked pickleball court.</p>

<p>Charles, entering the match undefeated this season and carrying what several spectators politely described as a “noticeable chip on his shoulder,” paired with steady veteran Jay Baker. Across the net stood Jerry Charlup and Nick Cirillo, a duo known more for chaotic highlight-reel points than consistency — until today.</p>

<p>The match began with a rally so long that two separate players reportedly asked, “Are we still playing the same point?” Charles opened the game with a blistering cross-court forehand that skidded off the wet line like a hockey puck. Jerry responded with an improbable no-look wrist-flick winner that caught even Nick off guard.</p>

<p>Then came the collapse.</p>
